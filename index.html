        <h4> How I Got Started </h4>
        <p> Originally, I had started my music journey taking 
            singing lessons. That only lasted about six months 
            before I had quit. About a year and a half after 
            that, my mom told me that I should have a creative
            outlet as a way to channel my emotions in a healthy 
            way. My first instrument was ukelele, but it seemed 
            too easy after a year, or so. Then I'd started guitar.
            My sister had started playing years ago, so I felt
            comfortable enough. Playing guitar felt like I was in
            my sister's shadow even more than before, so I 
            stopped playing.  </p>
        <p> The reason I stared bass, though, is a little funny. When COVID hit, me and my family got really close. Especially me and my sister, CeCe. In the fall of 2021, CeCe started playing music at public events, but she had said something felt off about the sound. Since I already played a couple instruments, she decided that I would be her personal bassist. </p>
